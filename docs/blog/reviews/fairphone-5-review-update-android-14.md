# Fairphone 5 Review Update - Android 14

> Originally published: 16 June 2024

A short while ago, I made
a [review of the Fairphone 5, after using it for ~2 months](https://harmelodic.com/blog/fairphone-5-review-after-2-months).

In this review, I recommend the Fairphone 5, though I had a bunch of minor issues with the Fairphone 5. Many of them
were issues that I figured were likely issues with Stock Android (though as I made clear in the previous post, I believe
that Fairphone is at fault for me experiencing these issues).

On the 15th July, Fairphone [released](https://www.fairphone.com/en/2024/07/15/android-14-is-here-heres-whats-changed/)
a new build version of Fairphone OS (Fairphone's Android-based operating system): `FP5.UT20.B.041`.

This build is their Android 14 release!

So... have my issues been resolved? Any new issues appeared? Let's find out:

---

> 60Hz default

🔧 This wasn't really much of an issue, since I can still use 90Hz provided I set it.

> NFC icon persists

✅ It's gone! I can't re-enable it, which seems odd and not good for those who maybe liked it, but I'm not in that crowd.

> Data transfer icons appear & disappear

✅ No longer happening! Similarly to the NFC icon, can't seem re-enable them, but I'm not wanting to.

> Default launcher sucks

🔧 I switched to Nova Launcher, which works much better. I quickly tried the default Android launcher (Quickstep) and it
still kinda sucks.

> The speaker is not very good

📱 It's a hardware issue, not going to be fixed.

> It's a bit chonky & heavy

📱 It's a hardware design issue, not going to be fixed.

> No 3.5mm jack has already stung

📱 It's a hardware design issue, not going to be fixed.

> No Android 14 yet

✅ It is here!

> Side fingerprint sensor

📱 It's a hardware design issue, not going to be fixed.

> Camera Exposure issue

📱 Doesn't seem to have massively improved, which makes me think it's a hardware issue.

> Quick-open Camera glitch

✅ Used it a couple of times since I got the update and it seems to work pretty fine!

> Double Tap to Wake

🤷 So... not really improved, but at least more consistent (or maybe I've found how to make it consistent... not sure).

The double tap does work, but works differently under 2 kinda of conditions:

1. If the phone has been inactive for more than about 2 seconds, then it is about 5 seconds between double tapping and
   the screen turning on. 5 seconds might not sound long, but just count to 5 right now: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5 - that was quite
   long, ey? Still needs improvement.
2. If the phone has been inactive for only a second or so, then it is less than a second between double tapping and the
   screen turning on - i.e. the way it should be.

> Default notification sound is LOUD

✅ The notification sound is now a little quieter! However, the default notification sound "Pixie Dust" is still quite a
long notification sound, I prefer the quiet, low bloop of "Zirconium"

> It cost a lot of money

💰 Can't change what I paid for it.

> Pinned contacts in sharing doesn't work

✅ Seems to work now!

> I miss Pixel's good "At A Glance"

🔧 The normal Google "At a Glance" widget for non-Pixel devices is actually holding up pretty good - it's not quite the
same, but pretty good.

> I miss Pixel's "Now Playing"

💔 I do still miss this, but only when I remember I don't have it. I could follow
a [guide](https://9to5google.com/2022/06/30/google-pixels-now-playing-any-android-phone-how-to/) to get it, but the
guides involve installing things and doing things that I feel are... sketchy.

> Friend complains of a screen glitch when charging

⚡️ It's a glitch that I don't have, and thus not related.

---

Finally, something that I think is... shitty behaviour from Fairphone 🚫

As part of the [Android 14 update](https://www.fairphone.com/en/2024/07/15/android-14-is-here-heres-whats-changed),
Fairphone note the following:

> __No more Always Show Time and Info__: We removed the Always Show Time and Info feature on the Fairphone 5, as it was
> a major battery drainer, as per our data. With this removed, your Fairphone will now last longer than before on a single
> charge.

Uhhhh... what?! Fairphone removed a feature that was on the phone? I get that the data may show that it's a major
battery drainer, but I don't really think that a company should be allowed to remove existing features unless they have
security issues or if no one is using those features.

For me, this isn't an issue because I don't use that feature, but since I've already seen complaining that the feature
has been removed, it's *clearly* a feature that people desire, despite the battery effects.

I strongly urge Fairphone to re-enable the feature, and have it disabled by default, with a pop-up warning about the
battery effects for those enabling it.

So:

- 6 issues solved ✅
- 3 issues mitigated myself 🔧
- 1 software issue outstanding 🤷
- 5 hardware/design issues 📱
- 1 desire for a feature 💔
- 1 light wallet 💰
- 1 glitch-affected friend ⚡️
- 1 feature removed 🚫

...progress?
