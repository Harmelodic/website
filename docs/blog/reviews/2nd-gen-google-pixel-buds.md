# 2nd-Gen Google Pixel Buds Review

> Originally published: 15 June 2020

Before I bought the *Pixel Buds*, I was using the *OnePlus Bullets Wireless* - a pair of wireless (though not "
True-Wireless") earphones.

Honestly, I would have been happy to use the *Bullets Wireless* for the rest of my life. They had great battery life (
around 7-8 hours), fantastic comfort due to the little wings that come with them (of which they come in 3 different
sizes to cover different ear sizes) and had great audio quality.

Unfortunately, the build quality of the little button control on the wire didn't last forever. The rubber cover that
protected the volume & control switches warped after a few months and eventually fell off, resulting in the circuit
board underneath being exposed to the outside elements - which in rainy Britain, quickly kills earphones.

As a result, I was back using my wired earphones until I found a replacement - a pair of *Smile Jamaica In-Ear
Headphones* from *House of Marley*, which are a great pair of reasonably-priced, high-quality wired earphones with a
nylon-braided cable.

But I was still looking for a pair of wireless earphones with the following qualities:

- True-Wireless earbuds (I wanted to cut the cable entirely)
- Good Build Quality
- Sensible button/touch controls
- Small size and didn't protrude out of my ears a lot (I'm going to be on meetings a lot, plus if earphones protrude a
  lot then I find they fall out more)
- Wings for comfort and stability
- Silicone/rubber inserts for comfort, stability and passive audio isolation.
- No Active Noise cancellation - for no compromises on battery life and not blocking out outside noise (I like to be
  aware of the world around me)
- Decent battery life (5+ hours listening time)
- A small charging case that can fit in my pocket comfortably
- Bluetooth-connectivity so I can connect to my Macbook and to my Android phone
- Minimal audio connectivitiy glitches (cheap true-wireless are renowned for this)
- Not too bass-heavy
- Decent reviews from well-reputed Tech reviews (LinusTechTips, Marquess Brownlee, JimsReviewRoom, etc.)
- Not built by *Apple* (unless there is no other viable option)

Price was not really a consideration in this purchase, given I'd tested some cheap ass *Veatool J29s* for Â£18 off Amazon
and they were AWFUL, plus I have a decently-paid job that provides me with enough disposable income that I could afford
any of the expensive options - though I wasn't going to go for something *ridiculously* expensive.

As you will find, in the below points, the *Pixel Buds* cover all my requirements - some better than others.

## Review

### Purchasing experience

A few months back, I'd subscribed for stock notifications for the *2<sup>nd</sup>-Gen Google Pixel Buds*. On Monday (
13th), I received an email from Google telling me they were available and after a healthy audio-related debate with my
SO, I decided to buy them yesterday (14th) afternoon with expected delivery for Thursday (16th) but yet today (15th), my
*Pixel Buds* arrived. Delivered by DPD.  
Pretty quick postal service, especially considering the current COVID-19 situation - props to Google for sorting that
out.

### Unboxing

Upon ripping off the DPD packaging, the box is rapped in brown, recyclable cardboard (nice) with an easy pull tab to
open (nice).

The box itself is wrapped in plastic (ew) with a plastic tab with
an [OSHA hang hole](https://www.sorbentsystems.com/hang-holes.html). However, everything else about the box is made of
bleached white, high-quality cardboard (okay).

Pull off the top and you find the charging case (with *Pixel Buds* inside) wrapped in a plastic (ew) wrapper, with pull
tab & adhesive (ew) to remove.

Underneath the cardboard (nice) display holded, you'll find a little cardboard (nice) and plastic (ew) case containing
the large & small-sized gel tips (the mediums are already on the *Pixel Buds*).

Underneath this is another piece of cardboard (nice), and underneath this is the rubber-coated (eh) charging cable held
in place with a cardboard (nice) and adhesive (ew) frame.

At the very bottom of the box is the paper (nice) manual and Terms & Conditions, wrapped in a thin, plastic (ew) tab.

The charging case comes fully-charged with the *Pixel Buds* inside, also fully-charged.

### Build Quality

The charging case feels sooooooo good in the hand, with a soft matt, plastic white finish and a comfortable weight. The
magnetic lid snaps open and close with a satisfying feeling that I've already started to fidget with and the *Pixel
Buds* are held in place inside with strong magnetics.

The *Pixel Buds* have the same soft matt, plastic finish that feels good in the hand. The gel tips are held firmly in
place and the rubber wing-nub is soft, yet still firm. They are [IPX4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_Code) rated,
which will protect against "Splashing of water" - so not good to go swimming in, but a bit of sweat or rain won't harm
them.

The 1m charging-cable is rubber-coated, which I'm not a fan of (I prefer more durable nylon-braided cables), and Google
have
a [reputation with not shielding their cables properly](https://www.androidauthority.com/nexus-5x-touch-lag-charging-656869/),
so we'll have to see whether this holds up any better than previous Google cables I've used in the past.

### Comfort

Taking the *Pixel Buds* out, you realise how small and thin they are, compared to competitors that end up having these
chunky, protruding buds near-falling out of your ears - I'm looking at you, *Samsung Galaxy Bud*s, and you, *Anker
Soundcore Libery 2 Pro*s.

In the ear, I'd say the medium gel tips are a little on the small size compared to previous medium-sized gel tips I've
had on other earphones - that being said, the large gel-tips fit perfect for my goofy, big ears. I would say that if you
have more normal medium-sized ears, you might have to switch between the medium-sized gel-tips or the large-sized gel
tips to find which one provides the best comfort option.

Once in my ears, they feel really comfy.  
The wing-nubs ensure that they don't fall out, whilst not providing pressure on the ear that would become uncomfortable
during long-periods of wearing them (though only once you've positioned them correctly - if you don't have it quite
right, the wing-nub can feel like it's rubbing on your inner-ear a little).  
The gel-tip inserts comfortably into my ear canal without feeling like they're so far in that there is an air-tight seal
in place, or so far out that they don't feel "in".

I will say that the *OnePlus Bullets Wireless* are still *slightly* more comfortable though. The *Bullets Wireless* came
with replacable wings in 3 sizes, so you could get the comfort of the buds *just* right, whereas the *Pixel Buds*'
permanently fixed wing-nub doesn't provide that same sort of absolutely, perfect comfort.

### Speaker Sound Quality

Honestly, perfectly fine, if not personally preferable.

As I mention above, I don't like bass-heavy speakers of any kind (unless it's a dedicated bass-related speaker, like a
subwoofer), and I prefer my headphones/earphones tuned pretty flat, as I prefer to hear music and audio as it was
intended by the artist/studio, as opposed to having headphones/earphones that "colour" the sound a lot, usually in
favour of enriching the bass.

The *Pixel Buds* have an already great sound where I can hear the bass pumping through on tracks like
*[Old 45's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY5lgaeki38)*, whilst hearing clear trebles on solo instruments like in
*[The Monsters Inc. Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOCc8D2rbkQ)*. I listened to a couple of podcasts during the
day too, and the audio sounds good too, with voices and jingles sound clear.

I would say that they're on the quiet side, and that you'll find you'll be turning the volume up higher than on other
earphones you might have used, but that's not really a problem, given they still sound loud when on full volume.

If *Google* was going for a great all-round sound for the average consumer, then I think they've nailed it.

### Microphone Sound Quality

I had an initial hiccup on my first microphone audio test (a phone call to my SO), where the audio was apparently very
juttery and robotic (probably a glitch).

However, after I popped the buds back in their case and removed them again, the microphone audio has not glitched all
day and I've had reports from my colleagues and SO that I sound clear on calls and video meetings.

clip, [soundguys.com have a good clip here](https://www.soundguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/New-Pixel-Buds-voice-sample-adam.mp3?_=1).

### Battery Life

According to *Google* the battery life on the *Pixel Buds* is around 5 hours listening-time or 2.5 hours of talk-time,
and I'd say that's about right, if not a bit of an understatement given I went the entire afternoon with them in my ears
before they died (~5 hours) and I was intermintently changing between music and being in meetings.

The charging case will reportedly help you last a total of 24 hours listening-time, or 12 hours talk-time - can't verify
as I've only had them for a day.

The charging case also provides a quick-charge feature when you can pop dead earbuds in for 10 minutes and you get 2
more hours of listening-time, which I can confirm, as I did this today.

Finally, the charging case can be recharged using the USB-C (nice) port on the bottom, or via placing them on a Qi
charging pad or phone capable of providing power via Qi (also nice).

### User Experience

Generally, the User Experience of the *Pixel Buds* are fantastic.

Here's a couple of **positive** shout-outs:

**The Touch controls on the buds themselves are smooth and intuitive.**  
No clicky/tactile buttons that tend to push the buds further into the ear causing discomfort is #good.  
So on either bud, once in your ear:

- Swipe forwards, towards your face, to put volume up.
- Swipe back, towards your ear, to put volume down.
- Tap once to play, pause or accept a call.
- Tap twice to skip forward a track or reject a call.
- Tap thrice to skip back a track.
- Hold down for an assistant update on the time and on current notifications.
- Say "Hey, Google" or "OK, Google" to activate the assistant.

**The Pixel Buds App is decent**  
Not only does it provide you guides & animations on the touch controls, and general support, but it also gives you
features to handle *Pixel Bud* related settings like notifications, finding your *Pixel Buds*, enabling "Adaptive Sound"
and "In-ear detection", and handling Firmware updates.  
You also get access to more in-depth battery information, down to the percentage of each earbud.

**The little audio bloops that confirm Bluetooth connection and disconnection**  
They are lovely and it's like I have little cute squidgy creatures in my ears that make cute bloopy noises.  
No weird audio glitches, just bloopy-goodness.

and here's a few **annoyances/negative** shout-outs:

**The Pairing process is not intuitive**  
When pairing, I'd just want to open the case, take out the buds out and pop them in my ears and then open bluetooth
settings and pair them.  
It doesn't work like that.  
Instead, you have to *leave them in the case*, and just open the case to activate the pairing sequence, only THEN can
you pair them with a device.  
HOWEVER, once paired, if your device (be it Macbook or Android, etc.) remembers the *Pixel Buds* in its Bluetooth
settings, then reconnecting sequence is as simple as ensuring the *Pixel Buds* aren't connected to anything and
just...connecting to them from your chosen device.

**Occasional audio glitches on calls**  
I've found occasionally audio in my call cuts out slightly from one ear and then comes back a fraction of a second
later. This has a weird panning/stereo sound effect that isn't unpleasant like some other audio glitches I've had on
previous wireless audio devices, but it is a little weird to experience.

**Talking notifications on by default annoying**  
When I first setup the *Pixel Buds*, my phone auto setup having all WhatsApp messages not only providing the normal
audio notification, but a follow up message from the *Google Assistant* saying that if I "hold down on the *Pixel Buds*
then I can have the *Google Assistant* read out my notifications", which is helpful the first time, but VERY annoying
when it happens on EVERY WhatsApp notification.  
Thankfully this feature can be switched off in the *Pixel Buds* app.

### Conclusion

And that's it!

Solid all-round, good, true-wireless earbuds.
