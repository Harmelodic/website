## Why a new phone?

I used to have a Google Pixel 5a. In early May, I was scrolling through some photos and the phone just froze for a few
seconds, then the screen went black, and it wouldn't turn back on. It's a known issue with some Google Pixel phones,
nicknamed "The Black Screen of Death".

I'd resuscitated my partner's Pixel 5a from the same issue a few months prior by replacing the main board (resulting in
a complete data loss - thankfully she had backups for most things).

I decided instead of repairing my Pixel 5a for the umpteenth time (I've done a couple battery and screen repairs by this
point), it was time for a new phone.

I bought a Fairphone 5.

Note: Throughout this review I'll make reference to my Pixel 5a in comparison. Keep in mind:

- The Google Pixel 5a was released in August 2021.
- The Fairphone 5 was released in September 2023.
- The Pixel 5a cost me SEK4995 in
  2021 ([adjusting for inflation](https://www.inflationtool.com/swedish-krona/2021-to-present-value?amount=4995&year2=2024&frequency=yearly),
  this is SEK6075 in 2024 (about €541))
- The Fairphone 5 cost me SEK8490 in 2024 (about €757)

## Purchasing Decision

What did I want from a phone? Here was my thinking:

- Be a decent, mid-range Android phone. I don't need fancy features, but I don't want something cheap and will not last.
- Want a phone that will last a long time.
	- Decent specs that will not be be dated / slow within 5-10 years (I used [GSMArena](https://www.gsmarena.com) to do
	  comparisons to other phones)
	- Gets as many Android updates as I can (I use [Android Update Tracker](https://www.androidupdatetracker.com) to
	  discover this)
	- Be reasonably repairable, ideally very repairable - so I can fix it and keep it alive and running if it breaks.
- Strong preference for a phone made sustainably, because I want everyone to be paid fairly and the environment to not
  be destroyed in the process.
- Use a USB-C connector, because that's modern connector we use.
- Fingerprint sensor, ideally on the back, because it's ergonomic to use and I don't like using face-scanning systems.
- Ideally have a 3.5mm Headphone/Microphone jack, because I like to plug in my phone into speaker systems or
  occasionally use wired headphones.
- Dual SIM support (eSIM + physical SIM, ideally) as I'm a British citizen living in Sweden and have both a Swedish
  number (eSIM) and British number (physical SIM) and would like to keep both SIMs in the same phone.

The decision came down to:

- A Fairphone 5
	- Ticks most of my boxes
	- No headphone jack, sadly.
	- Fingerprint sensor is on the power button, rather than on the back, but that's not a major problem, right? (
	  Foreshadowing)
- Samsung A15
	- Ticks some of the boxes.
	- Fingerprint sensor is on the power button, rather than on the back.
	- Repairability, in comparison to the Fairphone 5, sucks, otherwise it'd be like most other phones I've had where I
	  need some heat, opening-pics and spudgers.
	- Sustainability of Samsung devices is... mixed. They'll use recycled materials and recycleable packaging but...
	  they're a fucking huge for-profit corporation that is contributing to the climate crisis, and their sustainability
	  statements on their website look mostly like green-washing, and I've seen reports of awful working conditions
	  being discovered at Samsung factories.
- Samsung A35
	- Basically the same as the A15, except slightly more powerful, an underscreen fingerprint sensor (meh) and no
	  headphone jack.

I believe the Fairphone was the most expensive of the 3, and honestly... as much as it ticked most of my boxes, it's
price was what made me genuinely consider the Samsung devices. I ultimately bit the bullet and coughed up the money for
the Fairphone 5, telling myself "This is what you have to pay to get a phone from a good, sustainable source".

The Google Pixel 8a had not been announced/released at this point.

## Findings

I discovered after purchasing it that Fairphone has an app pre-installed on the phone where you can request for support
and find out info about Fairphone news & things... which is mostly useless to me because I could just do all that
through their site.

HOWEVER, I found in the Fairphone app, that Fairphone offers a free Extended Warranty. Fairphone already offer a 2-year
warranty as standard, but they offer an extra 3 years on top of that, zif you register your phone. I did, so I now have
an Extended Warranty until 2029. Neat!... Although, applying for it through the Fairphone App didn't actually work, and
I had to do through the site - so room for improvement.

Anyway, __it's a decent Android phone__!

It does what I need it to do, in a snappy fashion, supports all the apps I need, and most of the functionality that I
want, and no major quirks.  
If you want a phone, and have similar expectations to me for what a phone should be, how it should function, and want to
support a supposedly more sustainable phone-manufacturing company: __Get a Fairphone 5__.

I have no major complaints... except for a few minor issues, some of which I've been able to mitigate:

### Minor issues

> ⚠️ NOTE BEFORE READING ISSUES:
>
> Fairphone ships with [Fairphone OS](https://support.fairphone.com/hc/en-us/articles/9979180437393-Fairphone-OS), which
> is basically vanilla (or "stock") Android, with some extra apps pre-installed (Google apps and the My Fairphone app).
>
> Many of the issues I detail below are likely issues with vanilla Android. However, it is my opinion that Fairphone
> could fix these issues by doing any/all of the following:
> - Contribute to Android and fix these issues directly, since Android is open-source, and then update their Fairphone
	OS to use the newer, fixed Android.
> - Update their Fairphone OS more regularly, since I believe some of these issues have already been fixed in newer
	versions of Android.
> - Fix/Patch the issues as part of their Fairphone OS version of Android.
>
> Since Fairphone is doing none of the above (as far as I can tell), I still treat these issues as "Fairphone issues",
> even if the root technical issue may be with vanilla Android.
>
> Theoretically, I could resolve some/all of my vanilla Android issues by rooting my phone and installing a custom ROM.
> I do not want to do this due to security, warranty, stability, and maintenance concerns.
>
> I've marked each issue below with a little comment as to where I think the root of the issue lies, in *italics*.

#### 60Hz default

*I'm pretty sure this is a Fairphone-specific issue.*

The phone comes with a screen capability of 90Hz, but it's set by default to be 60Hz. I believe the reason for this is
to save the battery life, since a lot of people won't notice, but I wanted the snappiness and don't mind the extra bit
of battery loss.

Mitigated: Go into settings and set screen refresh rate to 90Hz. My battery life has been pretty fine, reaching ~10-20%
after a day of heavy use (YouTube, TV-streaming, filming) and ~40-50% after a normal day (Messaging, bit of music, bit
of YouTube).

#### NFC icon persists

*I think this is likely a vanilla Android issue (see note above).*

Amongst the System Icons in the top right of the phone is a big square NFC icon. On the Fairphone 5, there is no
option/setting/anything that makes it go away.

I know I have NFC, I always have it on (for using Contactless payments), and I don't need to know that with the icon,
and the icon takes up a bunch of space and is a noticeably "chunkier" icon compared to the others. It'd be much tidier
if wasn't there.

However, after 2 months of usage, my brain/eyes have begun to notice it a little less.
I still want the option though.

#### Data transfer icons appear & disappear

*I think this is likely a vanilla Android issue (see note above).*

Just next to the NFC icon is the Network icons, things like Wi-Fi icons or the mobile signal icons.

I like those, but what I don't like is the fact that ANY time there is a data transfer going on (download or upload)
there are a couple of little triangles that appear next to those Network icons. Once the transfer is done, they
disappear.

This is already an eye-catching, distracting irritation, but it is exacerbated by the fact that when these Data-transfer
icons appear, the icons next to them (like the big NFC icon) shifts to the side to make room for the Data-transfer
icons. Once the Data-transfer icons disappear... they shift back. This is VERY eye-catching and really, *really*
annoying.

After 2 months... my brain/eyes hav begun to tune it out a bit, and whilst that sounds OK, I might remind you that the
icons exist to keep you aware of things, ideally important things, and if I'm tuning it out then that's also removing
THE POINT OF THE ICONS.

#### Default launcher sucks

*I think this is likely a vanilla Android issue (see note above).*

The default launcher for the Fairphone kinda sucks. It lacks customizability options, for example: it forces you to use
the Google search bar, and not be able to move it or change it out for a different search engine.

This is understandable since the default launcher is *Quickstep* - the default launcher for vanilla Android.

Nova Launcher to the rescue! It's a free launcher, though a paid version is available that is reasonably priced and
unlocks a bunch of useful customisability features.

After tweaking Nova Launcher every once in a while to get it how I like it, it's solved all issues I had.

So... mitigated, by not using the launcher given to me by Fairphone. Not a good look for Fairphone.

#### The speaker is not very good

*This is a Fairphone-specific hardware issue.*

At least compared to the Google Pixel 5a, the sound from the speaker sounds small and tinny.

Thankfully I don't use it often, but my partner has commented several times "oh no, can we not listen on your phone -
your phone sounds poopy".

That's not a good look.

#### It's a bit chonky & heavy

*This is a Fairphone-specific design issue.*

The Fairphone 5 is not a sleek, thin phone like the modern iPhones, Samsungs and Googles. It's not a super thick phone,
but it's noticeably thick and heavy, and then it ALSO has a camera bump as well as the normal thickness.

This makes holding it feel a little uncomfortable at times as the weight distribution feels a little off. It also means
that if I'm wearing some light trousers or shorts (as I tend to, in the summer) the weight of the phone is very
noticeable when cycling, though not really when walking.

When it's not in my pocket though, I definitely notice - though that might just be because I've nearly always had a
phone in my pocket for the last 14 years.

#### No 3.5mm jack has already stung

*This is a Fairphone-specific design issue.*

I do have wireless headphones (Sony WH-1000XM4's) this isn't too bad when I'm around the house, but I leave those at
home and use wired headphones in the office.

Meaning every day when I get up to go get lunch and I want to listen to music, I take my wired headphones and... realise
once again that I don't have a headphone jack.

I tried getting a USB-C to 3.5mm jack adapter but it was flimsy and broke, and I feel I'd lose it.

I could get wireless earbuds, but I've gone through 3 pairs of Google Pixel Buds (my favourite wireless ear buds to
date) and they are NOT repairable and... well, I've gone through 3 pairs!

Could get some Fairbuds... but they look a bit chonky. They do look a bit more repairable though, and I like the
replaceable battery...

Hm.

#### No Android 14 yet

*This is a Fairphone-specific software issue.*

The Fairphone 5 doesn't have Android 14 yet. I went from Google Pixel 5a with Android 14, to Fairphone 5 with Android
13.

It's not a big change, but there's a couple quality of life & privacy features that I would like to get back.

I saw somewhere that it Android 14 would be coming "this summer" so... any day now! 🤞

#### Side fingerprint sensor

*This is a Fairphone-specific design issue.*

A fingerprint sensor on the side isn't as ergonomic, or maybe it's too ergonomic. Either way, I still would have
preferred it on the back.

I often find myself with my hands in my pockets, and accidentally touching the fingerprint sensor and either (a) causing
the phone to unlock or (b) causing the phone to vibrate a little, as it reacts the touch... meaning I think I've got a
message or notification and so take out my phone to find... nothing.

Also, on my Google Pixel 5a, I'd sometimes press the power button to wake the phone and see the lock screen for
notifications or quick info. If I try doing that with the Fairphone 5, it usually results in unlocking the phone, which
I didn't want to do and so have to either relock the phone and try to not unlock it, or swipe to open the notification
tray.

Bit annoying. Rear fingerprint sensor would have been better.

#### Camera Exposure issue

*This is either a Fairphone-specific hardware issue, or a vanilla Android issue (see note above).*

When I use the camera app, especially as it's getting more into the summer, I've noticed the camera struggles with
exposure - as in, if the scene I'm taking a picture of is brightly lit, then the camera just "blows out" the phone and
doesn't compensate for the amount of light. If you tap on the thing that is blown out, then the phone does auto-focus
and adjusts for the light and THEN you can take the picture, but I'd really like the camera app to be a bit smarter than
how it is right now.

This exposure weirdness is also noticeable in other apps, such as BeReal. When a take BeReal or send a reaction to
someone, I've noticed (again) that the photos are often a little "blown out". This makes me think it's more of a
camera-sensor/hardware issue rather than a software one.

#### Quick-open Camera glitch

*This is likely a vanilla Android issue (see note above).*

I've also noticed that when I double-press the power button to open the camera (as I have that turned on in Settings and
I like that feature), the camera app often glitches a bit when it opens and I'm nearly always forced, in these cases, to
either retry double-pressing the power button, or unlocking and opening the camera app.

This sounds like a minor issue, but the point of this feature is to allow for getting your camera out when you need to
*quickly* and when the feature glitches, it means it's not achieving it's purpose.

#### Double Tap to Wake

*This is likely a vanilla Android (ssee note above) or hardware-compatibility issue.*

I've also enabled the "Double tap phone screen to wake phone" option in Settings, as I like to do that when my phone is
laid down and I want to quickly check the lock screen.

Sometimes, it works first time. However it is sadly quite temperamental and it's not clear on whether I'm pressing too
quickly, or too slowly, or it just doesn't work properly. This hasn't been something I've seen before with more "
vanilla" Android experiences, so could be a hardware-compatibility issue where the Fairphone hardware isn't working well
with how Android expects it to work to wake the device? I don't really know though, I feel like I'm just guessing on
this one.

This is a very annoying software bug since the feature is designed to be quick, and it's sluggishness and temperamental
nature make the feature basically useless.

#### Default notification sound is LOUD

*This is a Fairphone-specific software design issue.*

Pixel Dust is way to loud and long for a default notification sound.

I chose "Zirconium" instead, as a quiet, little, low bloop.

Please pick a better default, Fairphone.

#### It cost a lot of money

*This is a Fairphone-specific pricing issue.*

I covered this earlier, but it is a thought that occasionally pops back into my head.

SEK8490 is a lot of money, for what I view as a mid-tier phone. Even when comparing against the Google Pixel 5a, a
mid-tier phone from 2021, and adjusting for inflation, it is over SEK2000 more expensive (~€178).

#### Pinned contacts in sharing doesn't work

*This is likely a vanilla Android issue (see note above).*

Sometimes I like to share things with other people, as one does. For example, I complete the Wordle puzzle and like to
share it with:

- My partner on Signal.
- My aunt on WhatsApp.
- My colleagues on Slack.

Since I do this daily, I configured my sharing settings to "pin" these 3 places to share to.

Every day, when I try to share the Wordle, the "pinned" sharing locations do not show up as the first options. Sometimes
one of them does, but it's not consistent and so makes the "pinning" feature completely useless, and makes sharing much
more of a hassle.

This might be an Android bug, as I think I've seen it before and I don't remember having it on Android 14... but it's
annoying all the same and Fairphone *could* do something about it.

#### I miss Pixel's good "At A Glance"

*This is less of an issue, and more of a desire for a specific feature.*

Google make a widget called "At a Glance" where it shows info about the weather, your calendar, flight info, travel
info, etc. and it's quite useful, and it has some Pixel-only bits that made it SUPER useful.

Moving to the Fairphone, I started using the non-Pixel version of the widget and it looks a bit different and doesn't
function as well.

Looking on the internet, it might actually just be Google's new version of the widget, and they made it shitter (ah,
good ol' enshittification), but I miss my old useful At A Glance widget on my Pixel 5a.

#### I miss Pixel's "Now Playing"

*This is less of an issue, and more of a desire for a specific feature.*

Again, another Pixel-only feature! On the Pixel 5a, the phone has a feature where it basically is always listening for
music and if it hears music, it will tell you the song and artist that is playing. Basically like Shazam... except
always on and most usefully: Visible on the lock screen.

Google claimed it happened all locally, and would only record a few seconds and delete it straight after, so... not the
privacy nightmare that many think it might be.

#### Friend complains of a screen glitch when charging

*This is a Fairphone-specific hardware issue.*

Not happened to me, but a friend of mine got a Fairphone 5 and they found that when they plugged in their phone to
charge, the screen glitched a bit and a line appeared, going up through the center of the screen.

I recommended they send it in to Fairphone for a fix/replacement.

### Conclusion

The Fairphone 5 is a decent phone, if a little pricey, that has a few issues - many of them software-related.

I hope Fairphone improve the quality of their software - I see it as their major flaw.

__Would I recommend it?__

If you're buying an Android phone and paying for a sustainable phone? __Yes, absolutely.__

If you're buying an Android phone and you can't spend the money? Maybe get a Samsung A35, like a few people I know did.
