# Upgrading from Windows 7, 8 or 8.1

First off, you need to update your Windows system to the most recent version.

To do this, go to Start > Control Panel > Windows Update

Now click "Check for updates" and start upgrading your system. You may have to do this several times and restart your
computer several times if your system is quite out of date.

At some point, you'll receive a blue notification in the bottom right saying that your download is complete and Windows
is ready to upgrade.

If you click on the little Windows icon then the "Get Windows 10" window. Click "OK, let's continue".

You'll then get a loading screen saying "Working on it...". This will be there for a minute or two. It will then
disappear and a new window will appear called "Windows Update" saying "Great, we'll get the upgrade started".  
Click Accept.

We'll then get a loading bar and then the window will disappear.  
A new window will appear asking whether you want to start the upgrade now or later.  
You can wait until later but I'm impatient so let's do it now!  
Click Start the upgrade now.

The screen will fade to a purple screen saying "Restarting...". It will then fade to saying "Configuring update for
Windows 10" with a percentage counter.  
The configuration process will take a little time so go make yourself a cup of tea.  
It'll then change to say "Restarting" and then your PC will restart.

We'll then get a big black screen with a circular loading bar titled "Upgrading Windows". This bit is going to take a
while and as it states on the screen, your PC will restart several times so go make another cup of tea, even a bit of
cake. This is going to take a little over an hour.  
You may notice, and be interested in, that at the bottom of the screen, your PC is telling you what its doing. I dunno
why this is important for you to know (I guess in case of errors) but I thought it was kind of cool and dorky...

Once it's done, we'll get a screen saying "Hello there, welcome back!".  
Click next.

IMPORTANT, this next screen you want to go to the bottom left and click "Customise settings". DO NOT click "Use Express
Settings".

In the "Customise settings" section, TURN OFF EVERYTHING. If you require something in the future, you can turn it on if
you wish but for security's sake, turn everything off.  
Click next.  
Again, TURN OFF EVERYTHING. Especially the stuff in "Connectivity and error reporting".  
Click next.  
This page tells you about the new apps for Windows 10. You can read it, if you want.  
Click next.  
It'll state that it'll finalise your settings, and it'll boot into Windows 10.

Log in and Windows will proceed to set up your apps (This won't happen again, this is a one time thing).

Congratulations! Enjoy Windows 10! Remember to read my Configuring and Cleaning Blog to make sure your computer is safe
and secure from the security risks that Windows 10 causes!
