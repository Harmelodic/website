# Cast-iron cookware

Cast-iron pots and pans are great for cooking. It's durable, retains heat for a long time, and versatile (pots and pans
can be used on grills, in the oven or on a campfire - provided that any handles or other features can withstand the
temperatures).

Cast-iron cookware is subject to rust and sticking if not cleaned and maintained properly.

Store your cookware in a dry place, such as a cupboard or in your oven. Humidity increases the rate of rusting /
corrosion.

## Bare cast iron

Bare cast iron is cast iron that does not have a coating.

Note: Iron will likely leach from cast iron cookware into the food you cook. This can be beneficial for people with iron
deficiencies, but dangerous for people with "iron overload".

### Seasoning bare cast iron

Bare cast iron needs special "seasoning" maintenance in order to build up and maintain a stick-resistant surface that
aids cooking, helps prevent rusting and limits interaction with the iron of the cookware. This seasoning also affects
how you should clean the cookware.

Seasoning means applying fat (oil or animal fat) be coated and cooked into the cookware. A neutral-tasting oil with a
high smoke point (like vegetable oil) is recommended to avoid your food acquiring the taste of the oil too much and
avoids the oil from burning during seasoning.

To season:

- Pre-heat an oven to 180°C.
- Apply a thin layer of your chosen fat into all surfaces of the cast-iron cookware - including bottom, sides and
  handles to also prevent rusting on these parts. Use a clean kitchen cloth or towel to apply the fat.
- Place into the oven upside down and leave for about 1 hour for the fat to cook into the iron. Placing it upside down
  ensures excess fat does not cling to the cookware and helps the fat coating remain even.
- The cookware should come out with a slightly glossy black finish. Applying a little extra oil after can aid
  protection and stick-resistance.
- Re-season your cookware whenever you notice it lose any of that black finish. This can be after each time you use it,
  or after a few times. More often you season it and keep it protected, the longer it will last.

### Cooking with bare cast iron

Cooking with acidic foods (citruses, tomatoes, etc.) can damage the seasoning, so either be prepared to re-season your
cookware after cooking with acidic foods, or avoid cooking with them with cast-iron cookware.

Use wood utensils with cast-iron cookware to protect the cast iron and seasoning from being damaged. Using metal
utensils is OK provided you don't scrape on the cast-iron metal.

### Cleaning bare cast iron

To clean bare cast iron after use:

- Use small amounts of mild soap in warm water and gently remove all food debris ensure proper cleaning whilst not
  removing the seasoned coating.
- Use a wooden utensil to scrub larger pieces of food debris off.
- Use a little coarse salt to scrub any pieces of food debris that may still stick on.
- After, rinse and thoroughly dry with a kitchen towel or in a hot oven (180°C for 5 to 10 minutes).
- Do not wash seasoned cast iron in a dishwasher as this will remove the seasoned coating.

To remove rust (and seasoning):

- Use coarse salt as an abrasive and a kitchen cloth/towel to gently scrub off rust. Alternatively, gently scrub
  using a chain mail scrubber.
- Rinse thoroughly and dry completely. Consider placing the cast-iron cookware in a hot oven to ensure thorough drying.
- Remember to season your cookware after.

## Enameled cast iron

Enameled cast iron is cast iron with a "vitreous" or "porcelain" enamel glaze. This means the manufacturer has taken
powdered glass and fused it to the cast iron by firing.

Cooking with enameled cast iron requires more "fat" to be used during cooking than bare cast iron because enameled cast
iron is not as stick-resistant.

Enameled cast iron does not require as much maintenance as bare cast iron:

- Seasoning is not required.
- Cleaning is easier, but:
	- The cookware should be completely cool before cleaning, to prevent cracking the enamel.
	- Cleaning should be done with soft brushes or sponges with mild detergent to prevent damaging the
	  enamel (metal sponges/brushes should be avoided, as they will scratch and damage the enamel).
	- Stuck-on food can be loosened by soaking in hot, soapy water or by boiling water with a little baking soda.
- Parts of cookware that are not enameled (usually on edges) should be dried thoroughly after cleaning to prevent
  rusting.

The downsides of enameled cast iron are:

- Lessened ability to withstand searing heat.
- Lessened ability to resist sticking.
- It tends to be more expensive (since there's an extra process involved in manufacturing the cookware).
