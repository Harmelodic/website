When a person speaks out about a problem, do you:

1. Listen, and then address the problem
2. Listen, but do nothing
3. Don't listen, and do nothing
4. Attempt to silence the person

Hint: Only point #1 is correct.

_(Addressing usually involves fixing the problem, but this might not always be the best course of action for the
organisation / community. In these cases, it is still unacceptable to do nothing. Communication, transparency, empathy
and creating alignment are all vital to resolve the matter and prevent resentment or other social issues from
developing.)_
